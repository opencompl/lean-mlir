# Blase - **Bla**ter for **S**tr**E**ams

A decision procedure that is sound and complete for parametric bitvector expressions
with linear arithmetic, bitwise operationrs, zeroExtend, signExtend, and bitwidth constraints.

#### Algorithms Improvements TODO

- Check if a variable is used both as a width variable and a nat variable,
  and then complain about it.
