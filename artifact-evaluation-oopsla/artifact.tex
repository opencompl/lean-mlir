%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% \subsection{Abstract}

% {\em Obligatory}

\subsection{Artifact check-list (meta-information)}

% {\em Obligatory. Use just a few informal keywords in all fields applicable to your artifacts
% and remove the rest. This information is needed to find appropriate reviewers and gradually 
% unify artifact meta information in Digital Libraries.}

{\small
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Program: } The code repository for our framework along with the test suite. Note that this is already setup in the docker image.
  \item {\bf Compilation: } The Lean4 toolchain, downloaded via \texttt{elan}. Note that this is already setup in the docker image.
  \item {\bf Run-time environment: } Any operating system that supports Docker.
  \item {\bf Hardware: } Any x86-64 machine.
  \item {\bf Output: } Key theorems of the paper will be built and shown to have no unsound axioms.
  \item {\bf How much disk space required (approximately)?: } 10GB
  \item {\bf How much time is needed to prepare workflow (approximately)?: } 1hr
  \item {\bf How much time is needed to complete experiments (approximately)?: } 1hr
  \item {\bf Publicly available?: } Yes
  \item {\bf Code licenses (if publicly available)?: } MIT
  \item {\bf Archived (provide DOI)?: } 10.5281/zenodo.11519739

\subsection{Description}

\subsubsection{Software dependencies}

Docker is necessary to run our artifact.
The Docker image has all dependencies needed to compile our framework with Lean4.

\subsection{Experiment workflow}

Access the docker image \texttt{lean-mlir} from
\textcolor{red}{Zenodo link}.

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\scriptsize]{text}
  from folder lean-mlir: 
$ docker build -f artifact-evaluation/Dockerfile -t lean-image .
$ docker create --name temp-container lean-image
$ docker cp temp-container:/code/lean-mlir/bv-evaluation/raw-data ./docker-results
$ docker rm temp-container
\end{minted}

\subsection{Evaluation and expected results}


\subsubsection{Core Framework Theorems}

\subsubsection{Five Hardest Alive Examples}
\subsection{Paper Code Examples}
\subsection{Miscellanous Docker Usage}
To copy files for inspection from the docker container into the host,
 keep the container running, and in another
shell instance, use the \texttt{docker cp}
command to copy files from within the container out to the host:\footnote{For more about \texttt{docker cp}, please see: (\url{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/})}

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{text}
$ docker container ls # find   ID
$ docker cp <CONTAINERID>:<PATH/INSIDE/CONTAINER> \
            <PATH/OUTSIDE/CONTAINER>
\end{minted}
