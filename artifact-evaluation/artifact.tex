\subsection{Description}

\subsubsection{Software dependencies}

Docker is necessary to run our artifact.
The Docker image has all dependencies needed to compile our framework with Lean4.

\subsection{Experiment workflow}

Access the docker image \texttt{opencompl-ssa} from
\url{https://zenodo.org/records/11506328}

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\scriptsize]{text}
$ docker load -i opencompl-ssa.tar
$ docker run -it siddudruid/opencompl-ssa
# | This clears the build cache,
# | fetches the maths library from the build cache,
# | and builds our framework.
$ cd /code/ssa && lake clean && lake exe cache get && lake build
# | This allows to check that the key theorems of our framework are
# |guarded, and that they do not contain `sorry`s.
$ rg -g "**/*.lean" "#guard_msgs in #print axioms" -C2 | grep "sorry"
$ rg -g "**/*.lean" "#guard_msgs in #print axioms" -C2
\end{minted}

% \subsection{Full Workflow Example}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Evaluation and expected results}

On running \texttt{lake build}, the build succeeds with no errors.

Next, run:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\scriptsize]{text}
$ rg -g "**/*.lean" "guard_msgs in #print axioms" -C2 | grep "sorry"
\end{minted}

Grep returns no matches, which checks that all guarded theorems do not use the sorry axiom.
To manually inspect this, run:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\scriptsize]{text}
$ rg -g "**/*.lean" "#guard_msgs in #print axioms" -C2
\end{minted}

In the output, observe the following lines, which tells us that, for example, the 
theorem \texttt{denote\_rewritePeepholeAt} depends only on the axioms 
\texttt{propext}, \texttt{Classical.choice}, and \texttt{Quot.sound}. That is, this theorem 
\emph{does not depend} on axioms such as \texttt{sorryAx} that compromise the correctness of Lean's verification.

Now, since the Lean build was successful in the previous step, and since we use standard Lean axioms, 
we are justified in our claims that we have mechanized the key theorem statements from the paper.

Below, we list the key theorems that we claim to have mechanized, and their 
guarded verification below. Please inspect the output of 
\texttt{(\$ rg -g "**/*.lean" "\#guard\_msgs in \#print axioms" -C2 | grep "sorry")}
and confirm that these guarded statements occur, with the guard containing only the axioms \texttt{propext},
\texttt{Classical.choice}, and \texttt{Quot.sound}.

\subsubsection{Core Framework Theorems}

The core correctness claim of the peephole rewriter is guarded below:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\tiny]{text}
SSA/Core/Framework.lean

2423-/-- info: 'denote_rewritePeepholeAt' depends on axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] -/

2460:#guard_msgs in #print axioms denote_rewritePeephole
2461-
2462-end SimpPeepholeApplier
\end{minted}

\subsubsection{Five Hardest Alive Examples}

The correctness claim of the hardest Alive rewrites that time out on an SMT solver, which we verify 
for arbitrary bitwidth:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\tiny]{text}
SSA/Projects/InstCombine/AliveHandwrittenLargeExamples.lean
53-/--info: 'AliveHandwritten.DivRemOfSelect.alive_DivRemOfSelect' depends on

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Miscellanous Docker Usage}

To copy files for inspection from the docker container into the host,
 keep the container running, and in another
shell instance, use the \texttt{docker cp}
command to copy files from within the container out to the host:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{text}
$ docker container ls # find   ID
$ docker cp <CONTAINERID>:<PATH/INSIDE/CONTAINER> \
            <PATH/OUTSIDE/CONTAINER>
\end{minted}
For more about \texttt{docker cp}, please see:
(\url{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/})
