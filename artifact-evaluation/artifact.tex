\section{Artifact Appendix}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Abstract}

{\em Obligatory}

\subsection{Artifact check-list (meta-information)}

% {\em Obligatory. Use just a few informal keywords in all fields applicable to your artifacts
% and remove the rest. This information is needed to find appropriate reviewers and gradually 
% unify artifact meta information in Digital Libraries.}

{\small
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Program: } The code repository for our framework along with the test suite.
  \item {\bf Compilation: } Python for running the plotting scripts and the Lean4 toolchain, downloaded via \texttt{elan}
  \item {\bf Run-time environment: } Any operating system that supports Docker.
  \item {\bf Hardware: } Any x86-64 machine.
  \item {\bf Output: } Key theorems of the paper will be built and shown to have no unsound axioms.
  \item {\bf How much disk space required (approximately)?: } 10GB
  \item {\bf How much time is needed to prepare workflow (approximately)?: } 1hr
  \item {\bf How much time is needed to complete experiments (approximately)?: } 1hr
  \item {\bf Publicly available?: } Yes
  \item {\bf Code licenses (if publicly available)?: } MIT
  \item {\bf Archived (provide DOI)?: }
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Description}

\subsubsection{Hardware dependencies}

None.

\subsubsection{Software dependencies}

Docker is necessary to run our artifact. The Docker image has all dependencies needed to compile our framework with Lean4.

\subsection{Experiment workflow}

Access the docker image \texttt{opencompl-ssa} from
(\url{http://doi.org/TODO-TODO-TODO-DOI}), then run:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\scriptsize]{text}
$ docker load -i opencompl-ssa.docker
$ docker run -it siddudruid/opencompl-ssa
# | This clears the build cache,
# | fetches the maths library from the build cache,
# | and builds our framework.
$ cd /code/ssa && lake clean && lake exe cache get && lake build
\end{minted}


Upon running \texttt{make -j4 test}, the test output is printed to \texttt{stdout}.
The scripts \texttt{speedup-time.py} and \texttt{speedup-rgn-time.py},
produce PDFs \texttt{speedup-time.pdf} and \texttt{speedup-rgn-time.pdf}
in the directory \texttt{/code/lz/test/lambdapure/compile/bench/}:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{text}
/code/ssa/related-work/alive/compile/bench/speedup-time.pdf
\end{minted}

To open the pdf file, keep the container running, and in another
shell instance, use the \texttt{docker cp}
command to copy files from within the container out to the host:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{text}
$ docker container ls # find   ID
$ docker cp <CONTAINERID>:<PATH/INSIDE/CONTAINER> \
            <PATH/OUTSIDE/CONTAINER>
\end{minted}
For more about \texttt{docker cp}, please see:
(\url{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/})


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Evaluation and expected results}

On running \texttt{lake build}, the build succeeds with no errors.
On applying the path \texttt{patch -p1 < axioms.diff} and rebuilding with \texttt{lake build},
one should see the axioms that are used by each theorem. Check that these do not use \texttt{sorry},
by running \texttt{lake build 2>\&1 | grep Axioms} and verify by looking that `sorry` is never on this list.

\subsection{Full Workflow Example}

% \begin{minted}[fontsize=\tiny]{text}
% # Grab docker image from http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5786074
% $ curl https://zenodo.org/record/5786074/files/cgo22.docker?download=1 > cgo22.docker
% $ docker load -i cgo22.docker
% $ docker run -it siddudruid/cgo21-v4
% $ su nonroot # switch to non-root user
% $ export PATH=/code/llvm-project/build/bin:$PATH

% $ export PATH=/code/lz/build/bin:$PATH
% $ export LEANLIB=/code/lean4/build/release/stage1/lib
% $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LEANLIB:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
% $ cd /code/lean4/build/release/ && make -j test # NO test failures
% 100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 648
% 
% Total Test time (real) = 399.28 sec
% [100%] Built target test
% 
% $ cd /code/lz/test/lambdapure/compile/bench && \
% ./speedup-time.py --data --plot --nruns 10
% 
% $ cd /code/lz/test/lambdapure/compile/bench && \
% ./speedup-rgn-time.py --data --plot --nruns 10
