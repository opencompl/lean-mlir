## Generic Refinement Relation

/-! ### Syntax -/

/--
The notation typeclass for heterogenous refinement relations.
This enables the notation `a ⊑ b`, where `a : α` and `b : β`.

NOTE: This typeclass is not intended for dialect implementors. Please implement
`DialectRefinement` instead, from which appropriate `HRefinement` instances will
be inferred.
-/
class HRefinement (α β : Type) where
  /--
  We say that `a` is refined by `b`, written as `a ⊑ b`, when
  every observable behaviour of `b` is allowed by `a`.

  Note that this notation is driven by a typeclass, thus the exact meaning
  is type-dependent.
  -/
  IsRefinedBy : α → β → Prop

@[inherit_doc] infix:50 " ⊑ "  => HRefinement.IsRefinedBy

/--
The homogenous version of `HRefinement`.
This enables the notation `a ⊑ b`, where `a, b : α`.

NOTE: This typeclass is not intended for dialect implementors. Please implement
`DialectRefinement` instead.

class Refinement (α : Type) where
  IsRefinedBy : α → α → Prop

`DialectHRefinement` defines an heterogenous refinement relation accross two dialects.

Various instances of the ` ⊑ ` refinement notation will be derived from `DialectHRefinement`.
In particular, this class defines refinement for monadic values, from which
refinement of pure values `x, y` is defined as `pure x ⊑ pure y.`

## Normal Forms

In a concrete dialect, we expect to have a kind of waterfall of refinement
instances. Take, for example, the LLVM dialect:
* Firstly, there is the `PoisonOr _` type, which has a refinement relation.
* Then, there is the `LLVM.IntW w` type, which is a (semireducible!) alias for
  `PoisonOr (BitVec w)`. Because it is not reducible, it has its own refinement
  instance.
* Using the latter, there is the `DialectHRefinement` instance for the LLVM
  dialect.
* This `DialectHRefinement` instance implies refinement instances for both
  monadic value `LLVM.m ⟦t⟧` and pure values `⟦t⟧`.

Recall, however, that LLVM is a *pure* dialect (that is, `LLVM.m` is `Id`).
Suppose we had a `MemLLVM` dialect, which also captures memory side effects,
then we'd expect the following refinement instances:
* We still start with `PoisonOr _` and `LLVM.IntW _`, and their refinement.
* Then, we expect some `EffectM` monad, which will have a refinement instance
  for `EffectM α`, with `α` being some generic type with a refinement instance.
* Using both of the above, we then define the `DialectHRefinement` instance,
  which implies the same refinement instances as before.

Note that in either case, the semantics content is defined at the top of the
list, with the instances after `DialectHRefinement` simply being ways to express
this refinement for alternative spellings of the same type.

Thus, although a rewrite like `toMonad_pure_IsRefinedBy_toMonad_pure_iff`
*in general* seems like a good idea (the rhs is a simpler expression, after all),
for a concrete dialect this rewrite is actually hiding the semantic content by
going *down* this list of instances.

Luckily, we have a dedicated simpset intended for concrete rewrites, `simp_denote`.
Thus, we add set of lemmas to this simpset which rewrite the derived instances
in terms of the original `DialectHRefinement` instance.

We expect dialect implementors to then add their dialect-specific simplemmas to
`simp_denote`, to go all the way up the list of instances.

`reduceIsRefinedBy` simplifies `HRefinement` instances that are derived by an `DialectHRefinement`
instance into an application of `DialectHRefinement.IsRefinedBy`.

NOTE: this simproc matches on *all* occurences of `HRefinement.IsRefinedBy`, which could potentially
be expensive. Ideally, we'd include the specific instances we're searching for in the discrtree key.
Furthermore, we have a tendency to rewrite `toType t` into the underlying type,
so we do *not* want `toType`, or `Dialect.m` or similar methods to be part of the index.

For example, this could be one of the rewrites that are expressed by this simproc:
```
theorem monadic_isRefinedBy_iff (x : d.m ⟦t⟧) (y : d'.m ⟦u⟧) :
    @HRefinement.IsRefinedBy (no_index _) (no_index _) (instRefinementMonadic) x y
    ↔ DialectHRefinement.IsRefinedBy x y := by rfl
```
However, even if we write these rewrites as simp-lemmas: the instances are *not*
part of the discrtree key indexing, so the above will *also* match against all
occurences of `HRefinement.IsRefinedBy`.

    TODO: we probably only want to simplify these instances if the dialects `d`
    and `d'` are concrete. Meaning if `d` and `d'` are not just fvars (although
    we probably should allow them to be *contain* fvars, so that, say,
    `MetaLLVM φ` is still considered concrete).

**How to define refinement on computations?**

So far, when verifying the Alive peephole rewrites, we've used the following
definition of refinement, where `c` and `d` are LLVM programs with the same
context and return type:
```
  ∀ V, c.denote V ⊑ d.denote V
```
Saying that `c` is refined by `d` when for any valuation `V` the denotation of
`c` under `V` is refined by the denotation of `d` under `V`.

Of course, this definition really only makes sense if `c` and `d` can be evaluated
under the exact same contexts. Thus, to generalize this to multiple dialects, we'd
instead write something like
```
  ∀ V₁ V₂, V₁ ⊑ V₂ → c.denote V₁ ⊑ d.denote V₂
```

Now, the second definition is *not* in general equivalent to the first.
However, if we add the following assumption, that the denotation is monotone
w.r.t. refinement, then we can prove that the two definitions are logically
equivalent:
```
  ∀ V₁ V₂, V₁ ⊑ V₂ → c.denote V₁ ⊑ c.denote V₂
```

It's slightly annoying to have this extra proof burden. Then again, semantics
really ought to be monotone in this way, so it might not be bad to force a proof.
In particular, VeLLVM had a bug in it's semantics which meant it was *not* monotone,
but this really was a bug. The intention of LLVM semantics is that they are monotone.

Note that regardless, the statement of this property requires a notion of semantics,
and thus cannot be stated in the current file, unless we re-order the imports,
which might not actually be a bad idea.
