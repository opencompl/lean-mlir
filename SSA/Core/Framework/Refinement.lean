## Generic Refinement Relation
-/


/-! ### Syntax -/

/--
The notation typeclass for heterogenous refinement relations.
This enables the notation `a ⊑ b`, where `a : α` and `b : β`.

NOTE: This typeclass is not intended for dialect implementors. Please implement
`DialectRefinement` instead, from which appropriate `HRefinement` instances will
be inferred.
-/
class HRefinement (α β : Type) where
  /--
  We say that `a` is refined by `b`, written as `a ⊑ b`, when
  every observable behaviour of `b` is allowed by `a`.

  Note that this notation is driven by a typeclass, thus the exact meaning
  is type-dependent.
  -/
  IsRefinedBy : α → β → Prop

/-!
For now, we define `· ⊑ ·` as a *scoped* notation, meaning you have to write
`open RefinementNotation` to use it. This is an interim solution until we finish
porting the existing LLVM dialect automation to use the generic refinement
typeclass rather than it's own `⊑` notation.
Once that is done, we will make the notation global.
-/
namespace RefinementNotation
@[inherit_doc] scoped infix:50 " ⊑ "  => HRefinement.IsRefinedBy
end RefinementNotation
open RefinementNotation

/--
The homogenous version of `HRefinement`.
This enables the notation `a ⊑ b`, where `a, b : α`.

NOTE: This typeclass is not intended for dialect implementors. Please implement
`DialectRefinement` instead.
-/
class Refinement (α : Type) where
  IsRefinedBy : α → α → Prop

instance [Refinement α] : HRefinement α α where
  IsRefinedBy := Refinement.IsRefinedBy

/-- Equality induces a trivial (homogenous) refinement relation on any type `α`. -/
def Refinement.ofEq : Refinement α where
  IsRefinedBy := Eq

/-! ### Dialect Refinement -/

/--
`DialectHRefinement` defines an heterogenous refinement relation accross two dialects.

Various instances of the ` ⊑ ` refinement notation will be derived from `DialectHRefinement`.
In particular, this class defines refinement for monadic values, from which
refinement of pure values `x, y` is defined as `pure x ⊑ pure y.`
-/
class DialectHRefinement (d : Dialect) (d' : Dialect) [TyDenote d.Ty] [TyDenote d'.Ty] where
  /--
  We say that `a` is refined by `b`, written as `a ⊑ b`, when
  every observable behaviour of `b` is allowed by `a`.
  -/

/--
A lawful homogenous (i.e., within a single dialect) refinement instance is one
where refinement is reflexive and transitive (i.e., it is a preorder).

  isRefinedBy_trans : ∀ {t u v : d.Ty} (x : d.m ⟦t⟧) (y : d.m ⟦u⟧) (z : d.m ⟦v⟧),
    x ⊑ y → y ⊑ z → x ⊑ z

**How to define refinement on computations?**

So far, when verifying the Alive peephole rewrites, we've used the following
definition of refinement, where `c` and `d` are LLVM programs with the same
context and return type:
```
  ∀ V, c.denote V ⊑ d.denote V
```
Saying that `c` is refined by `d` when for any valuation `V` the denotation of
`c` under `V` is refined by the denotation of `d` under `V`.

Of course, this definition really only makes sense if `c` and `d` can be evaluated
under the exact same contexts. Thus, to generalize this to multiple dialects, we'd
instead write something like
```
  ∀ V₁ V₂, V₁ ⊑ V₂ → c.denote V₁ ⊑ d.denote V₂
```

Now, the second definition is *not* in general equivalent to the first.
However, if we add the following assumption, that the denotation is monotone
w.r.t. refinement, then we can prove that the two definitions are logically
equivalent:
```
  ∀ V₁ V₂, V₁ ⊑ V₂ → c.denote V₁ ⊑ c.denote V₂
```

It's slightly annoying to have this extra proof burden. Then again, semantics
really ought to be monotone in this way, so it might not be bad to force a proof.
In particular, VeLLVM had a bug in it's semantics which meant it was *not* monotone,
but this really was a bug. The intention of LLVM semantics is that they are monotone.

Note that regardless, the statement of this property requires a notion of semantics,
and thus cannot be stated in the current file, unless we re-order the imports,
which might not actually be a bad idea.
