# MLIR Dialect Domain Specific Language
This file sets up generic glue meta-code to tie together the generic MLIR parser with the
`Transform` mechanism, to obtain an easy way to specify a DSL that elaborates into `Com`/`Expr`
instances for a specific dialect.

`elabIntoCom` is a building block for defining a dialect-specific DSL based on the geneeric MLIR
syntax parser.

For example, if `FooOp` is the type of operations of a "Foo" dialect, we can build a term elaborator
for this dialect as follows:
```
elab "[foo_com| " reg:mlir_region "]" : term => SSA.elabIntoCom reg q(FooOp)
--     ^^^^^^^                                                        ^^^^^
```
