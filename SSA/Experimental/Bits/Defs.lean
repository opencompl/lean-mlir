# Term Language
This file defines the term language the decision procedure operates on,
and the denotation of these terms into operations on bitstreams -/

/-- A `Term` is an expression in the language our decision procedure operates on,
it represent an infinite bitstream (with free variables) -/
inductive Term : Type
| var : Nat → Term
/-- The constant `0` -/
| zero : Term
/-- The constant `-1` -/
| negOne : Term
/-- The constant `1` -/
| one : Term
/-- Bitwise and -/
| and : Term → Term → Term
/-- Bitwise or -/
| or : Term → Term → Term
/-- Bitwise xor -/
| xor : Term → Term → Term
/-- Bitwise complement -/
| not : Term → Term
/-- Append a single bit the start (i.e., least-significant end) of the bitstream -/
| ls (b : Bool) : Term → Term
/-- Addition -/
| add : Term → Term → Term
/-- Subtraction -/
| sub : Term → Term → Term
/-- Negation -/
| neg : Term → Term
/-- Increment (i.e., add one) -/
| incr : Term → Term
/-- Decrement (i.e., subtract one) -/
| decr : Term → Term

Evaluate a term `t` to the BitStream it represents,
given a value for the free variables in `t`.

Note that we don't keep track of how many free variable occur in `t`,
so eval requires us to give a value for each possible variable.

/-- `t.arity` is the max free variable id that occurs in the given term `t`,
and thus is an upper bound on the number of free variables that occur in `t`.

Note that the upper bound is not perfect:
a term like `var 10` only has a single free variable, but its arity will be `11` -/

Evaluate a term `t` to the BitStream it represents.

This differs from `Term.eval` in that `Term.evalFin` uses `Term.arity` to
determine the number of free variables that occur in the given term,
and only require that many bitstream values to be given in `vars`.
