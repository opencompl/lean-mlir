# Updating the auto-generated statements


(0. Make sure that _the alive repository is initialized and up-to-date: `git submodule init && git submodule update`)
1. Run alive script to generate `AliveAutoGenerated.lean`: 
  - Go to the alive script submodule repository: `cd related-work/alive/alive` (from the `ssa` (this) repository root)
  - Make sure you have the right environment for this to work. With nix: `NIXPKGS_ALLOW_INSECURE=1 nix-shell`. (It needs this environment flag because it uses python2.)
  - Run the generating script: `./1-tolean.py`

# Split and extract statements

Due to some bugs, if you run the flow above, you might get some errors from the translation. Currently these are manually fixed in `AliveAutoGenerated.lean`. 

1. Optional: To eliminate the mistranslated files you can run `python3 split-and-procces.py`. 
2. To extract the statements, run `python3 update_alive_statements.py`
