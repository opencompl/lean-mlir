# Updating the auto-generated statements


(0. Make sure that _the alive repository is initialized and up-to-date: `git submodule init && git submodule update`)
1. Run alive script to generate `AliveAutoGenerated.lean`: 
  - Go to the alive script submodule repository: `cd related-work/alive/alive` (from the `ssa` (this) repository root)
  - Make sure you have the right environment for this to work. With nix: `NIXPKGS_ALLOW_INSECURE=1 nix-shell`. (It needs this environment flag because it uses python2.)
  - Run the generating script: `./1-tolean.py`

# Outdated: split and extract statements
There used to be a flow to extract out the simplified statements and then split out the ones that  don't work.
This was deprecated (unknown if intentionally?) by https://github.com/opencompl/alive/commit/8563d42a
Here are the steps (but they wont work with the current structure and outputs).

2. Run `extract_alive_statements.sh`.
3. Some statements in `AliveAutoGenerated.lean` won't work. We separate them into two filesTo fix this, run `./splitandprocess.py`
4. Celebrate!
