warning: ././.lake/packages/mathlib/././Mathlib/Data/List/Defs.lean:241:9: `List.decidableChain'` is missing a doc-string, please add one.
Declarations whose name ends with a `'` are expected to contain an explanation for the presence of a `'` in their doc-string. This may consist of discussion of the difference relative to the unprimed version, or an explanation as to why no better naming scheme is possible.
note: this linter can be disabled with `set_option linter.docPrime false`
